#Guessing_number_game
A simple command-line Python game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

How It Works

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program will provide feedback:
"Too low!" if the guess is less than the target number.
"Too high!" if the guess is more than the target number.
"Congratulations!" if the guess is correct.
The game tracks how many attempts the user takes to guess the correct number.
